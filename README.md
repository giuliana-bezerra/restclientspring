## Overview
This app configures a generic REST client using Spring which is responsible for performing calls to a target server.

## Setup
This app depends on:

- Java 8
- Maven 3.3.9

Follow the steps to execute the app:

1. Download the repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:giuliana-bezerra/restclientspring.git
```
2. Generate the jar using Maven:
```
mvn clean
mvn package
```
3. Import the generated jar to a project.

## Usage
The client can be used either to GET or POST calls. RestClient can be injected and used for calling services throughout GET and POST HTTP methods. To this end, a request (Request class) and a resource should be passed to this client. The Resource is a class that implements the resource interface, which represents the resource accessed by the service client.

## Reference
See javadoc.

## Limitations
This app only supports GET and POST operations.

## Development
This app implements a base client that allows remote calls to a REST service. Contributions could be adding support to other operations and
authentication strategies.
